        <td colspan="2"><span class="style5">I heard about cryptograhy while I was studying at 10th. I created a small program in Visual Basic that encypted( actually replaced ) characters with some about other not-so-used character. But it didn't accept any code. Later I learned Java and my first full project I did with it was Encrypter. The first version was developed while I was studying at higher secondary. It used  encryption code. But it had many shortcomings due to my lack of experience in Java. So I left it there. I did many projects in Java and actually worked as a part-time programmer in a firm and after one and half year I rebuilt the project from scratch. Now I have cleared many errors  made in the previous version and have strictly adhered to the general programming methodolgy and I believe that I have done something valuable.</span></td>
