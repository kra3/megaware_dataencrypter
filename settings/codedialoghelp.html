To know more about Multilevel encryption refer to the quick help provided on that window. The selected algorithms hierarchy will be displayed on the Code Dialog when done. </td>

The algorithms play with numbers, so many codes may generate many sequence and the wrong code entered for decryption may actually decrypt the file to a junk value. So keep a backup copy of encrypted file.But it is guaranteed that only the correct code will give you the correct decryption . Even a change in last digit by 1 value will give the wrong output. So do have full faith in the program. </span></td>

In version 1.0, when an encrypted file is added all the details of encryption such as algorithm used, whether equation used , hint etc (code and equation are not stored any where) are also stored along with encrypted data. It is a great assistance during decryption. But some times discarding the storing of these settings can be a added security feature. Also in Multilevel encryption  the order of algorithms is very important, So if they are not saved, the algorithms need to be specified in correct order and provides more security. To enable this feature this check box is used. If the checkbox is checked, then the settings will be stored else the settings will be discarded and will not be stored anywhere. </td>
