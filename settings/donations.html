        <td class="style2">As for this program,this is a freeware that is developed under the GPL. Truly speaking while developing the first version I never wanted it to be free and  without any mercy I used the words 'Copyrighted and All rights reserved' in them. Later I realized the importance of open source softwares and developed it under the opensource development support website www.sourceforge.net. But for many opensource programmers money is not a problem and programming is a hobby. But for me it is a livelihood . As I am a student I can't afford to even use the broadband facility to upload the files into CVS repository of website and it is done by my friend.</td>

      <tr>
        <td class="style2">If this program is created for a specific user , I can demand as much as money  but this is a general purpose program so I cannot do so. So if you found this project useful and would like to support my dream projects you can send me donations to the address given in the credit sections or through the www.sourceforge.net site (searching my project 'text encrypter'). Even if it is a dollar or 100 I am happy and grateful. </td>

      <tr>
        <td class="style2">Again even if you can't send me any donations,please take the trouble to send me an email to the address given in the credits tab. For me a single encouragement from a total stranger is a cheque worth $1000000.</td>
