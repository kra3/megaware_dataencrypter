    <td class="style4">The Multilevel Hierarchy Defenition Dialog is the same Algorithm Selection Dialog used in version 1.0 of encryter. But in version 2.0 we are introducing a new high security technology that is, Multilevel encryption . As the term refers, the data can be encrypted using different algorithms one after other. This series of algorithms to be used are defined using Multilevel Hierarchy Defenition Dialog which is discussed below. </td>

    <td class="style4">In Multi level encryption , you specify many algorithms as a chain and will be represented in a list. During encryption the data will be first encrypted using the first top level algorithm and the output of this algorithm, ie an encrypted content is again encrypted using the second algorithm in the list and so on. It makes the code unbreakable . </td>

But as said before, the algorithms are used from top to bottom and efficient use of algorithms can save time and provide maximum security. So if you have added the required algorithms to the list you can change their order by clicking the 'MOVE UP' and 'MOVE DOWN' buttons. Select an algorithm in the hierarchy list and then click 'MOVE UP'. It will  move the selected algorithm one level up and same procedure with 'MOVE DOWN' will move the selected algorithm one level down the hierarchy.<span class="style9">According to me an efficient pair is ALGORITHM META CBE --&gt; ALGORITHM SHUFFLE.ie , on the top of hierarchy ALGORITHM META CBE and next ALGORITHM SHUFFLE. </span></p>    </td>
