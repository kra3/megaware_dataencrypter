        any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the<br />
        Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent<br />
        that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or<br />
        combinations.
    </ul>
<p><b>2.2. Contributor Grant.</b></p>
<p>    <br>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br />

    not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further<br />
    Modifications or combinations.</p>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    <b>3.1. Application of License.</b></p>
<p>    <br>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br />
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br />
    Section <b>2.2</b>.  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br />
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of<br />
    this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a<br />
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br />
    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br />
    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License<br />
    or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an<br />
    additional document offering the additional rights described in Section<br />
    <b>3.5</b>.</p>
<p><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b></p>
<p>    <br>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br />
    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either<br />
    on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic<br />
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version<br />
    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,<br />
    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it<br />
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent<br />
    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such<br />
    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version<br />
    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is<br />
    maintained by a third party.</p>
<p><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b></p>
<p>    <br>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a<br />
    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the<br />
    date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the<br />
    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code<br />
    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial<br />
    Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable<br />
    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or<br />
    ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b></p>
<ul>
<p><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>.</p>
<p>	<br>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual<br />
	property right in particular functionality or code (or its<br />
	utilization under this License), you must include a text file with<br />
	the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the<br />
	claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a<br />
	recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge<br />
	after You make Your Modification available as described in Section<br />
	<b>3.2</b>, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br />
	You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as<br />
	notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably<br />
	calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new<br />
	knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>.</p>
<p>	<br>If Your Modification is an application programming interface and<br />
	You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to<br />
	implement that API, you must also include this information in the<br />
	LEGAL file.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>3.5. Required Notices.</b></p>
<p>    <br>You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the<br />
    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,<br />
    where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You<br />
    created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a<br />
    Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>. If it is not<br />
    possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its<br />
    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a<br />
    relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a<br />
    notice.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,<br />
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of<br />
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br />
    behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it<br />
    absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br />
    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the<br />
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br />
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br />
    indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b></p>
<p><br>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br />
    requirements of Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered<br />
    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br />
    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including<br />
    a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of<br />
    Section <b>3.2</b>.  The notice must be conspicuously included in any<br />
    notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in<br />
    which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You<br />
    may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of<br />
    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br />
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and<br />
    that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or<br />
    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights<br />
    set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under<br />
    a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms<br />
    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the<br />
    Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br />
    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br />
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You<br />
    offer.</p>
<p><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b></p>
<p>    <br>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br />
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br />
    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br />
    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br />
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or<br />
    regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to<br />
    the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the<br />
    code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file<br />
    described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all<br />
    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by<br />
    statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for<br />
    a recipient of ordinary skill<br />
    to be able to understand it.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>5. Application of this License.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached<br />
    the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b>, and to related Covered Code.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>6. Versions of the License.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    <b>6.1. New Versions</b>.</p>
<p>    <br>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish<br />
    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.  Each<br />
    version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>
<p><b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>. </p>
<p>    <br>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br />
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br />
    version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of<br />
    any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other<br />
    than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered<br />
    Code created under this License.</p>
<p><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>.</p>
<p>    <br>If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you<br />
    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered<br />
    Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that<br />
    the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL"<br />
    or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license<br />
    and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains<br />
    terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public<br />
    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or<br />
    Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall not of<br />
    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)</p>
</ul>
<p><b>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br />
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br />
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,<br />
    MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE<br />
    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH<br />
    YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE<br />
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY<br />
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<br />
    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE<br />
    IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>8. TERMINATION.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br />
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br />
    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br />
    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive<br />
    any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, must<br />
    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING<br />
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY<br />
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF<br />
    ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY<br />
    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER<br />
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK<br />
    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br />
    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED<br />
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL<br />
    NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH<br />
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH<br />
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION<br />
    OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION<br />
    MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48<br />
    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"<br />
    and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are<br />
    used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212<br />
    and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all<br />
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set<br />
    forth herein.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter<br />
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,<br />
    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it<br />
    enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions<br />
    (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),<br />
    excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in<br />
    which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or<br />
    registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless<br />
    otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License<br />
    (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be<br />
    subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying<br />
    all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement<br />
    shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of<br />
    JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall<br />
    be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br />
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br />
    California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br />
    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and<br />
    expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts<br />
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or<br />
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be<br />
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b></p>
<ul>
<p>    Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with<br />
    Section <b>3.4</b>, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or<br />
    indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based<br />
    on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues<br />
    you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You<br />
    agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an<br />
    equitable basis.</p>
